  "summary": "The diff implements the requested PWA install UX updates in `PWAInstallCallout.tsx`: a prominent primary \"Install\" CTA when programmatic install is available, removal of any \"Dismiss\" wording, manual-install instructions when not installable (including a browser/device availability disclaimer), and a secondary hide control (\"Not now\" and an X) persisted via localStorage. It also hides the callout after successful installation.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added an unused `clearCalloutHidden()` storage helper (extra API beyond the requested hide/persist behavior).",
      "reason": "REQ-52 only requires persisting the hidden choice; no requirement mentions a separate clear/reset API.",
