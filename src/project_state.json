  "summary": "Project \"vibechat\" is targeting a more strictly WhatsApp-like main navigation/UI, specifically using a top-level section order of Chats, Groups, Status, Live, then Videos, and removing prior advisory/help-style UI content that is not part of that WhatsApp-like experience.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Platform constraint: authentication must use Internet Identity; SMS verification/phone-based login is not supported. Any in-app password is app-level data (e.g., for extra gating) and not a replacement for II auth.",
    "Profile/registration UX: the \"name\" field should not require a full legal/real name; allow nicknames/handles and avoid copy implying otherwise.",
    "Requested login UX should mimic WhatsApp where possible, but must still authenticate via Internet Identity (no SMS/phone-number login or verification).",
    "Contacts integration requires explicit user permission and a privacy-forward UX; availability will vary by platform/browser (web vs mobile) and may require a fallback/manual contact discovery approach.",
    "User requests WhatsApp-like parity; implement as \"WhatsApp-like\" UX/features within platform/legal constraints rather than a literal 1:1 copy.",
    "WhatsApp message forwarding/bridging will require an official WhatsApp API integration (e.g., WhatsApp Business Platform) with significant policy/verification constraints; direct consumer WhatsApp message injection is generally not supported without approved APIs.",
    "UI direction: prioritize a WhatsApp-like top-level navigation with sections in this order: Chats, Groups, Status, Live, Videos; de-emphasize/remove auxiliary advisory/help UI from the primary experience."

  "known_issues": [
    "Production deployment failed with a deployment error when attempting to take Version 2 live.",

    "Login flow error: users report being unable to log in due to a \"profile failed\" message (likely profile load/save failure after Internet Identity auth).",
    "Potential version/deployment confusion: conversation references Version 7 being deployed/live while project state previously referenced Version 2/3/4 discrepancies.",
    "Users report login still failing (\"But it failed\"), likely tied to post-Internet Identity profile flow.",
    "Profile picture upload may fail due to missing device photo/gallery permission handling.",
    "Potential version/deployment confusion: assistant claims Version 15 is live in production, conflicting with previously tracked version states."
