  "summary": "REQ-17 is largely implemented by adding a new ProfilePhotoPicker with separate “From gallery” and “Take photo” actions, plus a CameraCaptureDialog that handles camera support/permission errors in clear English and returns a captured File for the existing preview/save flow. One acceptance-criteria detail (using a camera-capable file input with `capture`) is not evidenced; instead, the diff shows a custom camera dialog likely using getUserMedia via a `useCamera` hook.",

      "id": "REQ-17",
      "requirement": "In the profile setup step, users have an explicit UI option to take a new photo that uses a camera-capable file input (e.g., input capture) on supported mobile browsers.",
      "reason": "The diff shows the “Take photo” UI opening a custom `CameraCaptureDialog` backed by a `useCamera` hook (live video/canvas capture). There is no evidence of an `<input type=\"file\" capture>`-based implementation for camera capture.",
