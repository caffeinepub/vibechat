  "summary": "Project \"vibechat\" is being promoted to public production access, and scope includes adding in-app user registration (name, phone number, profile picture) plus an optional app-level password field stored in the backend (not SMS-based), updating the UI to include a WhatsApp-like headline/header area with additional far-end navigation items for \"Live\" and \"Videos\", adding a WhatsApp-like contacts integration that can read/sync device phone contacts (with user permission) to connect users, and adding support for storing and sending media attachments (photos/videos) within conversations.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Platform constraint: authentication must use Internet Identity; SMS verification/phone-based login is not supported. Any in-app password is app-level data (e.g., for extra gating) and not a replacement for II auth.",
    "Profile/registration UX: the \"name\" field should not require a full legal/real name; allow nicknames/handles and avoid copy implying otherwise.",
    "Requested login UX should mimic WhatsApp where possible, but must still authenticate via Internet Identity (no SMS/phone-number login or verification).",
    "Contacts integration requires explicit user permission and a privacy-forward UX; availability will vary by platform/browser (web vs mobile) and may require a fallback/manual contact discovery approach.",
    "User requests WhatsApp-like parity; implement as \"WhatsApp-like\" UX/features within platform/legal constraints rather than a literal 1:1 copy."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Production deployment failed with a deployment error when attempting to take Version 2 live.",
    "Potential version/deployment state confusion: assistant reported \"Version 4\" live for preview while project summary references Version 3 pending production publish.",
    "Login flow error: users report being unable to log in due to a \"profile failed\" message (likely profile load/save failure after Internet Identity auth).",
    "Potential version/deployment confusion: conversation references Version 7 being deployed/live while project state previously referenced Version 2/3/4 discrepancies.",
    "Users report login still failing (\"But it failed\"), likely tied to post-Internet Identity profile flow.",
    "Profile picture upload may fail due to missing device photo/gallery permission handling."
