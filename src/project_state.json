  "architectural_notes": [
    "Platform constraint: authentication must use Internet Identity; SMS verification/phone-based login is not supported. Any in-app password is app-level data (e.g., for extra gating) and not a replacement for II auth.",
    "Profile/registration UX: the \"name\" field should not require a full legal/real name; allow nicknames/handles and avoid copy implying otherwise.",
    "Requested login UX should mimic WhatsApp where possible, but must still authenticate via Internet Identity (no SMS/phone-number login or verification)."

  "known_issues": [
    "Production deployment failed with a deployment error when attempting to take Version 2 live.",
    "Potential version/deployment state confusion: assistant reported \"Version 4\" live for preview while project summary references Version 3 pending production publish.",
    "Login flow error: users report being unable to log in due to a \"profile failed\" message (likely profile load/save failure after Internet Identity auth).",
    "Potential version/deployment confusion: conversation references Version 7 being deployed/live while project state previously referenced Version 2/3/4 discrepancies."
